    desc: "The dataset focuses on the first 24 hours of data after ICU admission, encompassing both sepsis and non-sepsis patients. The train/test splits are first made temporally with the training and validation sets being comprised of icu patients admitted between 2016-2018, and the set with patients admitted between 2019-2020. The first 24 hours of patient data are used, up to the first true record of sepsis in the training  then samples are split randomly. It is anchored based on the time of ICU admission rather than the onset of sepsis, making it more relevant for real-time applications. Additionally, a prediction lag of 6 hours has been introduced to challenge the system's ability to detect sepsis onset early in the prediction horizon. All variables have been selected that have <75% missingness"
